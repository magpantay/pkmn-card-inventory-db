NOTES

just a throwaway file for me to keep some noted for you on
(You can format this to be pretty if you want idk how)

- made a crude data insertion program (DBinsert.py)
    - only adds mon and dex num to the primairy table, but might be a good starting point?
- I don't think dexNum is a good Primairy Key, as many cards are going to have the same dex number.
    - Maybe add new column for KEY? generate a new unique ID for every new card added?
    - Exact duplicates can still be added to DB with the cardInfo table? unsure I need to think about it more.
    - What are your thoughts?
