# Pokemon Card Inventory DB

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to have a descriptive and easy-to-query inventory of the Pokemon cards I have in my collection.

Each Pokemon and other card descriptors (ex. card series number, whether they're a foil and/or full-art card) will be stored in a SQL DB.

There will also be a program (likely in Python) written to easily query and modify the contents of the database.

## To-dos:

- Get @BleatyBoi up to speed on git  
- Plan the database schema
- Create the database
- Create a script that interfaces with the DB
- Verify and test functionality of script
